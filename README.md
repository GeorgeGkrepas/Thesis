# 📋 Overview
This is the project I created for my Electrical and Computer Engineering degree's thesis. It's a Unity game in virtual reality that's multiplayer and has an educational goal, or is otherwise known as a "Serious Game". The game is of the trivia genre where the player has to complete four pair matches based on the question given. Points are awarded to the player that answers the question first and the first one to 10 points wins! The game is titled "It's Elementary!" (or "Είναι Στοιχειώδες" in greek, my native language)

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Unity (Game Engine)
- Visual Studio (Code Editor)
- Photon (Multiplayer Services)
- Blender (3D Modeling)
- Oculus Quest 2 (VR Device)
- XML (Data Storage)

## 🌟 Project Highlights
### Virtual Reality
The main aspect of the game is that it's in VR. It was designed for and tested with the Oculus Quest 2. Virtual reality adds an essence of immersion and interactability that the game simply wouldn't have if it was a simple desktop application
### Multiplayer
The game was designed and created solely for multiplayer which adds competitiveness and engagement, both characteristics that boost knowledge retention, quick thinking and improve social interaction
### Educational Goal
Making a plain trivia game wouldn't be an interesting topic for a thesis, so making it educational adds another layer to the game design process. An educational game needs to be fun but also deliver knowledge without too much complication, especially when it's for children
